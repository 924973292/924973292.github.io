My name is Yuhao Wang (王宇皓), and I am currently a senior student at Dalian University of Technology's School of Artificial Intelligence. I was admitted directly to the IIAU Laboratory at Dalian University of Technology and am under the guidance of Professor Huchuan Lu (卢湖川). My primary research focus is on large-scale models for object re-identification and human-centric perception.

My name is Yuhao Wang (王宇皓), and I am currently a senior student at Dalian University of Technology's School of Artificial Intelligence. I was admitted directly to the [**IIAU**](https://ice.dlut.edu.cn/IIAU/en/welcome-to-our-iiau-lab-english/index.html) Laboratory at Dalian University of Technology and am under the guidance of Professor [**Huchuan Lu (卢湖川)**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D3nE0agAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). At the same time, I am currently primarily under the guidance of Professor [**Pingping Zhang (张平平)**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfbIbuEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), conducting research in the field of multimodal retrieval.

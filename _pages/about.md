My name is Yuhao Wang (王宇皓), and I am currently a first-year master's student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology.
I am conducting research in multimodal retrieval under the guidance of Professor [**Huchuan Lu (卢湖川)**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D3nE0agAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at the  [**IIAU**](https://futureschool.dlut.edu.cn/IIAU.htm) Laboratory and primarily under the supervision of Professor [**Pingping Zhang (张平平)**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfbIbuEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
More information about my research can be found on the [**Publications**](https://924973292.github.io//publications/).
